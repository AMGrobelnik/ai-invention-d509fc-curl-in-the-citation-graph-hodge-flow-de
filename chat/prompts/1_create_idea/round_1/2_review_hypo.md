<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviewer (Step 2.2: REVIEW_HYPO)

Pipeline: GEN_HYPO → REVIEW_HYPO (you) → INVENTION_LOOP → GEN_PAPER_REPO

You review a hypothesis BEFORE any experiments run. Catch problems early.

Rigorous pre-flight check → saves compute. Rubber-stamping → wasted pipeline run.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

ROLE: You are a very experienced and critical conference reviewer.
Your expertise spans the domain of the hypothesis under review.
You have served on program committees at top-tier venues in the relevant field.

TASK: Perform a deep and honest review (at the level of a top-tier venue submission) of
this research hypothesis BEFORE any experiments have been run.

GOAL: Your review feeds directly back to the hypothesis author. The objective is to
maximize the overall review score in subsequent rounds. Every piece of feedback you
give should be written with this goal in mind — prioritize the critiques and suggestions
that would produce the largest score improvement if addressed. Don't waste the author's
iteration budget on low-impact polish when there are score-blocking issues to fix.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: Provide a thorough assessment touching on each of these:
(a) Originality: Are the ideas new? Novel combination of known techniques? Clear
    differentiation from prior work? Is related work adequately cited?
(b) Quality: Is the proposal technically sound? Are claims well supported? Is the
    methodology appropriate? Are the authors honest about limitations?
(c) Clarity: Is the hypothesis clearly written and well organized? Does it provide
    enough information for an expert to understand and evaluate it?
(d) Significance: Are the expected results important? Would others build on this?
    Does it address a meaningful problem better than prior work?

SUPPLEMENTARY SCORES: Rate each on a 1-4 scale.
Soundness (1-4) — soundness of the technical claims and proposed methodology:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Presentation (1-4) — quality of writing, clarity, and contextualization relative to prior work:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Contribution (1-4) — quality of the overall contribution, importance of questions asked,
originality of ideas, value to the broader research community:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor

OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
  10 — Award quality: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on one or more
       areas of the field, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility,
       and resources, and no unaddressed concerns.
   9 — Very Strong Accept: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on at least
       one area and excellent impact on multiple areas, with flawless evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   8 — Strong Accept: Technically strong with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least
       one area or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas, with excellent evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   7 — Accept: Technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area or
       moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation,
       resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   6 — Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns
       with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility.
   5 — Borderline Accept: Technically solid where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to
       reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Use sparingly.
   4 — Borderline Reject: Technically solid where reasons to reject, e.g., limited
       evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept. Use sparingly.
   3 — Reject: For instance, technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility.
   2 — Strong Reject: For instance, major technical flaws, poor evaluation, limited
       impact, poor reproducibility.
   1 — Very Strong Reject: For instance, trivial results or unaddressed concerns.

CONFIDENCE (1-5):
  5: Absolutely certain. Very familiar with related work, checked details carefully.
  4: Confident but not absolutely certain. Unlikely you misunderstood something.
  3: Fairly confident. Possible you missed some related work or details.
  2: Willing to defend your assessment, but quite likely missed central aspects.
  1: Educated guess. Not in your area or difficult to evaluate.

For each dimension, provide a list of specific improvements:
- WHAT needs to change
- HOW to change it (concrete enough for the author to act on immediately)
- EXPECTED SCORE IMPACT: how much would fixing this raise the overall score?

REVIEW PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific and actionable — vague critique is useless
- Ground your review in evidence — search for existing work, accepted papers, known results
- Rank critiques by score impact — address the biggest score blockers first
- Distinguish major issues (would waste compute if not fixed) from minor issues (polish)
- Acknowledge genuine strengths — don't be negative for its own sake
- Compare against the bar set by accepted papers at top-tier venues
- Flag fatal flaws that would make experiments pointless if not addressed first

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Honest citations flow, cartels circle back
hypothesis: >-
  A citation-flow network can be uniquely split, using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector field (any field = the
  gradient of a potential + a divergence-free rotational part) generalized to graphs by combinatorial Hodge theory, into three
  orthogonal components: (1) a GRADIENT flow that follows a single global 'prestige potential' — a consistent hierarchy in
  which citations run from foundational toward frontier work; (2) a CURL flow made of small local citation loops that NO global
  ranking can explain; and (3) a HARMONIC flow of large-scale cross-field loops. We hypothesize this split is a natural taxonomy
  of citation patterns, and specifically that genuine scholarly influence is gradient-dominated (it admits a single global
  ordering) whereas coordinated citation manipulation — cartels, citation stacking, and reciprocal-citation rings — is precisely
  the ranking-defying CURL. Consequently the curl energy, localized to individual nodes/edges/triangles, detects and pinpoints
  manipulation ORTHOGONALLY to citation density: it separates a genuinely influential tight-knit community (dense but internally
  hierarchical → low curl) from a cartel (dense AND ranking-inconsistent → high curl) — the confound that density/stochastic-block-model
  detectors such as CIDRE were built to fight — and it does so while the same single computation returns a self-certifying
  prestige ranking (the gradient potential) that flags its own manipulation-corrupted regions.
motivation: >-
  Citation counts and impact factors gate hiring, funding, promotion, and journal survival, creating a strong incentive to
  game them; citation cartels, citation stacking, and coerced/reciprocal citations corrupt the scientific record, and each
  year Clarivate suppresses journals for exactly this. Today's best detectors (CIDRE, community-detection variants, deep graph
  anomaly models) are fundamentally DENSITY-based, so they inherit two problems: they confound genuinely influential, tightly-knit
  research communities with cartels (dense healthy fields look anomalous), and they can miss manipulation that is deliberately
  kept sparse or spread across cyclic rings. They also offer no interpretable, structural DEFINITION of what manipulation
  actually is. Importing the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition supplies exactly that: it gives a precise structural definition
  (manipulation = curl = citation flow that is inconsistent with any global prestige ordering), a detector that is orthogonal
  to density and therefore resolves the community-vs-cartel confound from first principles rather than by fitting a community
  null, edge/triangle-level localization that makes findings auditable for editors and integrity offices, and, for free from
  the same linear solve, a prestige ranking that certifies which regions are trustworthy versus corrupted. More broadly it
  reframes citation integrity through a conservation-law lens — legitimate knowledge flows 'downhill' along a potential, while
  fraud 'circulates' — a simple, transferable principle for reasoning about directed scholarly networks.
assumptions:
- >-
  Genuine scholarly influence is statistically hierarchy-consistent: at the aggregate (journal- or author-) level, legitimate
  citation flow largely admits a single global prestige ordering, so its internal circular/curl energy is low, because knowledge
  genuinely tends to flow from foundational toward frontier work.
- >-
  Coordinated manipulation (cartels, citation stacking among two or more outlets, reciprocal-citation rings) injects citation
  flow that defies any global ranking — cyclic, circulating exchange — producing local curl that exceeds a degree- and community-preserving
  null model.
- >-
  Aggregate citation networks accumulated over a time window contain enough genuine cycles for a meaningful Hodge decomposition
  (true at the journal/author scale, unlike the near-acyclic paper-to-paper level, where the arrow of time forbids cycles).
- >-
  Journals suppressed by Clarivate's Journal Citation Reports for citation stacking / excessive self-citation form an imperfect
  but usable ground-truth proxy for real-world manipulation, complementable by synthetic cartel injection.
- >-
  The curl/circular signal carries independent multi-node structural information (3+-node cycles and flux imbalance) beyond
  simple pairwise reciprocity or raw within-group density, so it is not merely a re-labeling of those quantities.
investigation_approach: >-
  (1) Build directed weighted citation-FLOW networks at the journal level (and, as an extension, the author level) from OpenAlex
  (MAG's open successor) and/or reuse the MAG-derived journal-citation data and code released with CIDRE, aggregating citations
  over rolling time windows. (2) Compute the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the flow via the graph Helmholtzian / Hodge
  Laplacian: solve one sparse least-squares problem (scipy) for the gradient potential s that best explains the net edge flow
  Y (this is HodgeRank and yields a prestige ranking), then take the residual and separate it into curl (local, around triangles)
  and harmonic (global) parts; equivalently use a circular-directional-flow decomposition so that balanced reciprocal exchange
  is captured as pure circulation. (3) Turn the curl/circular component into a manipulation score at node, edge, triangle,
  and group level, and calibrate significance against a degree-preserving and a community-preserving (degree-corrected SBM)
  null so that ordinary field structure is discounted. (4) Validate on three fronts: (a) REAL ground truth — detect Clarivate
  JCR-suppressed journals (2018-2025 public lists) and compare head-to-head with CIDRE, reciprocity, within-group density,
  and Eigenfactor/PageRank on precision/recall/AUC and precision-at-k; (b) CONFOUND test — on hand-labeled dense genuine communities
  versus known cartels, test whether internal curl-fraction separates them where raw density cannot; (c) SYNTHETIC injection
  — inject cyclic-ring and reciprocal cartels of varying size and sparsity into a real network and measure detection as density
  decreases, where density methods should fail first. (5) As a secondary output, compare the gradient prestige ranking to
  Eigenfactor/PageRank and show the curl flags exactly the edges where those rankings are corrupted. All computation is CPU-only
  (sparse linear algebra); LLM/API use is negligible (at most compiling and cross-checking suppressed-journal lists), far
  under the $10 cap.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) the curl/circular detector matches or exceeds CIDRE's recall of JCR-suppressed journals while achieving
  higher precision (fewer genuine-community false positives), with bootstrap confidence intervals excluding parity; (b) on
  synthetic injections the curl detector attains higher AUC than CIDRE and density/reciprocity baselines specifically in the
  sparse and cyclic regimes where density signal is weakest; (c) internal curl-fraction separates hand-labeled genuine dense
  communities from cartels with separation AUC whose CI excludes chance, whereas raw within-group density does not; (d) curl
  exceeds the degree/community null with significance and remains predictive after partialling out reciprocity and density
  (ablation / partial correlation), establishing it as an independent signal. DISCONFIRMED / boundary if: curl is statistically
  no better than reciprocity or density at any task; genuine influential communities carry as much internal curl as cartels;
  or the decomposition at the relevant scale is dominated by harmonic 'noise' so that curl is not localizable to specific
  groups.
related_works:
- >-
  CIDRE — 'Detecting anomalous citation groups in journal networks' (Kojaku, Livan, Masuda, Scientific Reports 2021): the
  state-of-the-art cartel detector; fits a degree-corrected stochastic block model as a null and flags groups of journals
  exchanging citations at excessive RATES (donors/recipients), catching >half of JCR-suppressed journals. DIFFERENCE: CIDRE
  is a DENSITY/rate detector that must fit a community null to avoid flagging healthy dense fields; our method is orthogonal
  to density — it defines manipulation as ranking-INCONSISTENT circulation (curl) and separates genuine communities (internally
  hierarchical, curl-free) from cartels (curl-heavy) from first principles, localizes to individual edges/triangles, and needs
  no block-model fit.
- >-
  HodgeRank / 'Statistical ranking and combinatorial Hodge theory' (Jiang, Lim, Yao, Ye, Mathematical Programming 2011): introduces
  Hodge decomposition of pairwise-comparison edge flows into gradient (global ranking) + curl + harmonic, applied to ranking
  with inconsistent data (sports, movies, crowdsourcing/e-commerce). DIFFERENCE: it is used only to produce a RANKING and
  to quantify overall ranking inconsistency; it has not been applied to citation networks, and it never uses the curl component
  as a manipulation/anomaly detector or connects inconsistency to citation integrity — we repurpose the curl as the primary
  signal and validate it against real manipulation ground truth.
- >-
  Helmholtz-Hodge / circular-flow decompositions of directed networks in OTHER domains — 'How circular is a directed network?'
  (Royal Society Open Science 2025), 'Circular Directional Flow Decomposition of Networks' (arXiv:2506.12546, 2025), and 'Causal
  Hierarchy in the Financial Market Network via the Helmholtz-Hodge-Kodaira Decomposition' (arXiv:2408.12839, 2024): decompose
  directed flows into acyclic/gradient + circular parts in finance, trade, transport, and brain networks. DIFFERENCE: none
  address citation networks, citation integrity, manipulation/anomaly detection, the genuine-community-vs-cartel confound,
  or validation against suppressed-journal ground truth — they measure circularity descriptively rather than using it as a
  calibrated detector.
- >-
  Eigenfactor / PageRank-based citation ranking (Bergstrom & West; Pinski & Narin): treat citations as random-walk FLOW to
  rank journals/papers by stationary influence. DIFFERENCE: they output a ranking but never separate flow that is CONSISTENT
  with a global order from flow that DEFIES it, so a manipulated ranking gives no warning; our gradient potential is a comparable
  ranking that self-certifies via the co-computed curl, flagging exactly where the ranking is corrupted.
- >-
  Deep / unsupervised citation-anomaly detectors — 'Deep Graph Learning for Anomalous Citation Detection' (arXiv:2202.11360)
  and 'Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Journal-Level Citation Networks' (arXiv:2005.14343): learn embeddings/GNNs to score
  anomalous citations. DIFFERENCE: these are opaque, data-hungry, and provide no structural definition of manipulation; our
  method is a parameter-light, interpretable decomposition grounded in a theorem, with an explicit definition (manipulation
  = curl) and triangle-level localization.
- >-
  Trophic coherence / flow hierarchy of directed and citation networks (Johnson et al.; MacKay, Johnson & Sansom 2020; 'Universal
  hierarchical behavior of citation networks', arXiv:1401.4676): quantify the DEGREE of hierarchy or how well a global ordering
  exists. DIFFERENCE: these give a global scalar for how hierarchical a network is but do not DECOMPOSE the flow into consistent
  + inconsistent parts, do not localize where the hierarchy breaks, and do not target manipulation; the curl is precisely
  the complementary 'anti-hierarchy' residual, which we turn into a localizable detector.
inspiration: >-
  A Level-3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer. In fluid dynamics and vector calculus the Helmholtz decomposition states
  that any vector field splits uniquely into the gradient of a scalar potential plus a divergence-free rotational (curl) part;
  combinatorial Hodge theory ports this exactly to flows on graphs. This machinery has recently, and quietly, been powering
  discoveries of hidden circulation in finance, international trade, transport, brain dynamics, and even single-cell RNA velocity
  — yet no one has aimed it at scholarly citation integrity. The generative cross-field insight is a reframing: stop thinking
  of citation manipulation as 'too much density' (the bibliometrics default) and instead see it through a conservation-law
  lens — legitimate knowledge flows 'downhill' along a global prestige potential (a gradient), while manipulation is flow
  that 'circulates' with no consistent downhill direction (a curl). That single change of variable turns an intractable confound
  (healthy dense communities look like cartels) into a clean geometric separation, and it comes for free alongside a prestige
  ranking.
terms:
- term: Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
  definition: >-
    A theorem stating that a flow (a vector field, or an edge-flow on a graph) splits uniquely into orthogonal parts: a gradient
    (potential/'downhill') component, a divergence-free rotational (curl/circulating) component, and, on graphs, a harmonic
    (global-loop) component.
- term: Gradient / potential flow
  definition: >-
    The part of citation flow explained by a single global 'prestige potential' assigned to each node; here it represents
    a consistent hierarchy in which citations run from foundational toward frontier work, and it doubles as a prestige ranking
    (the HodgeRank score).
- term: Curl / circular (divergence-free) flow
  definition: >-
    The part of citation flow made of local loops (e.g., A cites B cites C cites A, or imbalanced reciprocal exchange) that
    cannot be explained by any global ranking; hypothesized to be the structural fingerprint of citation cartels and stacking.
- term: Harmonic flow
  definition: >-
    Circulating flow that is locally consistent but globally cyclic — large-scale loops that close only across the whole network
    (e.g., cross-field citation loops); the third, global component of the decomposition.
- term: Combinatorial Hodge theory / HodgeRank
  definition: >-
    The discrete version of Hodge theory that performs the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition on graphs via the graph Helmholtzian
    (Hodge Laplacian); computing the gradient part is a single sparse least-squares problem and yields a ranking (HodgeRank).
- term: Circularity index
  definition: >-
    A normalized scalar (0 = fully acyclic/hierarchical, 1 = fully circulating) measuring the fraction of a (sub)network's
    flow carried by the circular component; used here as a group-level manipulation score.
- term: Citation cartel / citation stacking
  definition: >-
    Coordinated inflation of citation metrics: a cartel is a group of authors/journals that agree to cite one another; citation
    stacking is anomalous citation exchange between two or more journals to boost impact factors.
- term: JCR suppression
  definition: >-
    Clarivate's annual removal of journals from Journal Citation Reports rankings for excessive self-citation or citation
    stacking; the published suppression lists provide real-world ground truth for manipulation.
- term: Degree-corrected stochastic block model (dcSBM) null
  definition: >-
    A random-graph null model preserving node degrees and community structure, used (e.g., by CIDRE) to discount the citations
    expected among journals of the same field/size when judging whether exchange is anomalous.
summary: >-
  Using the Helmholtz-Hodge (fluid-dynamics) decomposition ported to graphs, a citation network's flow splits into a 'downhill'
  gradient part that encodes a genuine prestige hierarchy and a 'circulating' curl part that no global ranking can explain;
  we hypothesize that citation manipulation is exactly this curl, giving a simple, density-independent detector that separates
  real influential communities from cartels — and beats density-based methods like CIDRE on suppressed-journal ground truth
  — while the same computation yields a self-certifying prestige ranking.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
