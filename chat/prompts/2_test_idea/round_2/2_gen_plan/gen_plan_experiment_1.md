<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Citation loops reveal cartel structure
hypothesis: >-
  A citation-flow network can be decomposed, via combinatorial Hodge theory (the graph-theoretic port of the Helmholtz-Hodge
  decomposition), into three orthogonal components: (1) a GRADIENT flow consistent with a single global 'prestige potential';
  (2) a CURL flow made of local cyclic loops that no global ranking can explain; and (3) a HARMONIC flow of large-scale cross-network
  cycles. We hypothesize that coordinated citation manipulation—cartels, citation stacking, and reciprocal-citation rings—injects
  ranking-inconsistent cyclic flow (curl), while genuine scholarly influence is gradient-dominated. Crucially, the empirically
  strongest detector is NOT the triangle curl score directly, but the GRADIENT RESIDUAL: the per-node average absolute departure
  of observed net-flow from the prestige-potential prediction, which picks up ranking-inconsistent signals of ANY cycle length
  (not only triangles) by averaging over all incident edges, giving substantially higher statistical power. The triangle curl
  score (B₂ h★) is interpretable and localizes manipulation to specific 3-rings, but it is outperformed on detection AUC even
  when cartels are exactly 3-node rings (0.931 vs. 0.958), because the gradient residual accumulates evidence from every incident
  edge rather than only the subset forming triangles. For longer-ring cartels (k ≥ 4), the triangle curl will degrade further
  while the gradient residual remains informative; for these cases the CDFD (Circular Directional Flow Decomposition) all-cycle
  circularity index provides a mathematically complete alternative. The central structural advantage of both the gradient
  residual and curl over density-based methods (CIDRE, stochastic block models) is ORTHOGONALITY: by construction, a densely-connected
  but internally hierarchical research community carries zero curl and zero gradient residual, eliminating the community-vs-cartel
  confound without fitting a null model. This orthogonality claim holds by theorem; the empirical claim—that it translates
  into measurably better recall at equal precision on real suppressed journals—remains to be confirmed on real JCR data and
  with proper CIDRE (full dcSBM) as baseline. The partial correlation result (r=0.153, CI [0.074, 0.238]) from the synthetic
  experiment offers initial evidence that curl carries information independent of density and reciprocity, but this must be
  replicated on the real 231-journal OpenAlex+JCR dataset before the independence claim is established empirically.
motivation: >-
  Citation counts and impact factors gate hiring, funding, promotion, and journal survival, creating a strong incentive to
  game them; citation cartels, citation stacking, and coerced/reciprocal citations corrupt the scientific record, and each
  year Clarivate suppresses journals for exactly this. Today's best detectors (CIDRE, community-detection variants, deep graph
  anomaly models) are fundamentally DENSITY-based, so they inherit two problems: they confound genuinely influential, tightly-knit
  research communities with cartels (dense healthy fields look anomalous), and they can miss manipulation that is deliberately
  kept sparse or spread across cyclic rings. They also offer no interpretable, structural DEFINITION of what manipulation
  actually is. Importing the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition supplies exactly that: it gives a precise structural definition
  (manipulation = curl = citation flow that is inconsistent with any global prestige ordering), a detector that is orthogonal
  to density and therefore resolves the community-vs-cartel confound from first principles rather than by fitting a community
  null, edge/triangle-level localization that makes findings auditable for editors and integrity offices, and, for free from
  the same linear solve, a prestige ranking that certifies which regions are trustworthy versus corrupted. More broadly it
  reframes citation integrity through a conservation-law lens — legitimate knowledge flows 'downhill' along a potential, while
  fraud 'circulates' — a simple, transferable principle for reasoning about directed scholarly networks.
assumptions:
- >-
  Genuine scholarly influence is statistically hierarchy-consistent: at the aggregate (journal- or author-) level, legitimate
  citation flow largely admits a single global prestige ordering, so its internal circular/curl energy is low, because knowledge
  genuinely tends to flow from foundational toward frontier work.
- >-
  Coordinated manipulation (cartels, citation stacking among two or more outlets, reciprocal-citation rings) injects citation
  flow that defies any global ranking — cyclic, circulating exchange — producing local curl that exceeds a degree- and community-preserving
  null model.
- >-
  Aggregate citation networks accumulated over a time window contain enough genuine cycles for a meaningful Hodge decomposition
  (true at the journal/author scale, unlike the near-acyclic paper-to-paper level, where the arrow of time forbids cycles).
- >-
  Journals suppressed by Clarivate's Journal Citation Reports for citation stacking / excessive self-citation form an imperfect
  but usable ground-truth proxy for real-world manipulation, complementable by synthetic cartel injection.
- >-
  The curl/circular signal carries independent multi-node structural information (3+-node cycles and flux imbalance) beyond
  simple pairwise reciprocity or raw within-group density, so it is not merely a re-labeling of those quantities.
investigation_approach: >-
  (1) Build directed weighted citation-FLOW networks at the journal level (and, as an extension, the author level) from OpenAlex
  (MAG's open successor) and/or reuse the MAG-derived journal-citation data and code released with CIDRE, aggregating citations
  over rolling time windows. (2) Compute the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the flow via the graph Helmholtzian / Hodge
  Laplacian: solve one sparse least-squares problem (scipy) for the gradient potential s that best explains the net edge flow
  Y (this is HodgeRank and yields a prestige ranking), then take the residual and separate it into curl (local, around triangles)
  and harmonic (global) parts; equivalently use a circular-directional-flow decomposition so that balanced reciprocal exchange
  is captured as pure circulation. (3) Turn the curl/circular component into a manipulation score at node, edge, triangle,
  and group level, and calibrate significance against a degree-preserving and a community-preserving (degree-corrected SBM)
  null so that ordinary field structure is discounted. (4) Validate on three fronts: (a) REAL ground truth — detect Clarivate
  JCR-suppressed journals (2018-2025 public lists) and compare head-to-head with CIDRE, reciprocity, within-group density,
  and Eigenfactor/PageRank on precision/recall/AUC and precision-at-k; (b) CONFOUND test — on hand-labeled dense genuine communities
  versus known cartels, test whether internal curl-fraction separates them where raw density cannot; (c) SYNTHETIC injection
  — inject cyclic-ring and reciprocal cartels of varying size and sparsity into a real network and measure detection as density
  decreases, where density methods should fail first. (5) As a secondary output, compare the gradient prestige ranking to
  Eigenfactor/PageRank and show the curl flags exactly the edges where those rankings are corrupted. All computation is CPU-only
  (sparse linear algebra); LLM/API use is negligible (at most compiling and cross-checking suppressed-journal lists), far
  under the $10 cap.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) the curl/circular detector matches or exceeds CIDRE's recall of JCR-suppressed journals while achieving
  higher precision (fewer genuine-community false positives), with bootstrap confidence intervals excluding parity; (b) on
  synthetic injections the curl detector attains higher AUC than CIDRE and density/reciprocity baselines specifically in the
  sparse and cyclic regimes where density signal is weakest; (c) internal curl-fraction separates hand-labeled genuine dense
  communities from cartels with separation AUC whose CI excludes chance, whereas raw within-group density does not; (d) curl
  exceeds the degree/community null with significance and remains predictive after partialling out reciprocity and density
  (ablation / partial correlation), establishing it as an independent signal. DISCONFIRMED / boundary if: curl is statistically
  no better than reciprocity or density at any task; genuine influential communities carry as much internal curl as cartels;
  or the decomposition at the relevant scale is dominated by harmonic 'noise' so that curl is not localizable to specific
  groups.
related_works:
- >-
  CIDRE — 'Detecting anomalous citation groups in journal networks' (Kojaku, Livan, Masuda, Scientific Reports 2021): the
  state-of-the-art cartel detector; fits a degree-corrected stochastic block model as a null and flags groups of journals
  exchanging citations at excessive RATES (donors/recipients), catching >half of JCR-suppressed journals. DIFFERENCE: CIDRE
  is a DENSITY/rate detector that must fit a community null to avoid flagging healthy dense fields; our method is orthogonal
  to density — it defines manipulation as ranking-INCONSISTENT circulation (curl) and separates genuine communities (internally
  hierarchical, curl-free) from cartels (curl-heavy) from first principles, localizes to individual edges/triangles, and needs
  no block-model fit.
- >-
  HodgeRank / 'Statistical ranking and combinatorial Hodge theory' (Jiang, Lim, Yao, Ye, Mathematical Programming 2011): introduces
  Hodge decomposition of pairwise-comparison edge flows into gradient (global ranking) + curl + harmonic, applied to ranking
  with inconsistent data (sports, movies, crowdsourcing/e-commerce). DIFFERENCE: it is used only to produce a RANKING and
  to quantify overall ranking inconsistency; it has not been applied to citation networks, and it never uses the curl component
  as a manipulation/anomaly detector or connects inconsistency to citation integrity — we repurpose the curl as the primary
  signal and validate it against real manipulation ground truth.
- >-
  Helmholtz-Hodge / circular-flow decompositions of directed networks in OTHER domains — 'How circular is a directed network?'
  (Royal Society Open Science 2025), 'Circular Directional Flow Decomposition of Networks' (arXiv:2506.12546, 2025), and 'Causal
  Hierarchy in the Financial Market Network via the Helmholtz-Hodge-Kodaira Decomposition' (arXiv:2408.12839, 2024): decompose
  directed flows into acyclic/gradient + circular parts in finance, trade, transport, and brain networks. DIFFERENCE: none
  address citation networks, citation integrity, manipulation/anomaly detection, the genuine-community-vs-cartel confound,
  or validation against suppressed-journal ground truth — they measure circularity descriptively rather than using it as a
  calibrated detector.
- >-
  Eigenfactor / PageRank-based citation ranking (Bergstrom & West; Pinski & Narin): treat citations as random-walk FLOW to
  rank journals/papers by stationary influence. DIFFERENCE: they output a ranking but never separate flow that is CONSISTENT
  with a global order from flow that DEFIES it, so a manipulated ranking gives no warning; our gradient potential is a comparable
  ranking that self-certifies via the co-computed curl, flagging exactly where the ranking is corrupted.
- >-
  Deep / unsupervised citation-anomaly detectors — 'Deep Graph Learning for Anomalous Citation Detection' (arXiv:2202.11360)
  and 'Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Journal-Level Citation Networks' (arXiv:2005.14343): learn embeddings/GNNs to score
  anomalous citations. DIFFERENCE: these are opaque, data-hungry, and provide no structural definition of manipulation; our
  method is a parameter-light, interpretable decomposition grounded in a theorem, with an explicit definition (manipulation
  = curl) and triangle-level localization.
- >-
  Trophic coherence / flow hierarchy of directed and citation networks (Johnson et al.; MacKay, Johnson & Sansom 2020; 'Universal
  hierarchical behavior of citation networks', arXiv:1401.4676): quantify the DEGREE of hierarchy or how well a global ordering
  exists. DIFFERENCE: these give a global scalar for how hierarchical a network is but do not DECOMPOSE the flow into consistent
  + inconsistent parts, do not localize where the hierarchy breaks, and do not target manipulation; the curl is precisely
  the complementary 'anti-hierarchy' residual, which we turn into a localizable detector.
inspiration: >-
  A Level-3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer. In fluid dynamics and vector calculus the Helmholtz decomposition states
  that any vector field splits uniquely into the gradient of a scalar potential plus a divergence-free rotational (curl) part;
  combinatorial Hodge theory ports this exactly to flows on graphs. This machinery has recently, and quietly, been powering
  discoveries of hidden circulation in finance, international trade, transport, brain dynamics, and even single-cell RNA velocity
  — yet no one has aimed it at scholarly citation integrity. The generative cross-field insight is a reframing: stop thinking
  of citation manipulation as 'too much density' (the bibliometrics default) and instead see it through a conservation-law
  lens — legitimate knowledge flows 'downhill' along a global prestige potential (a gradient), while manipulation is flow
  that 'circulates' with no consistent downhill direction (a curl). That single change of variable turns an intractable confound
  (healthy dense communities look like cartels) into a clean geometric separation, and it comes for free alongside a prestige
  ranking.
terms:
- term: Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
  definition: >-
    A theorem stating that a flow (a vector field, or an edge-flow on a graph) splits uniquely into orthogonal parts: a gradient
    (potential/'downhill') component, a divergence-free rotational (curl/circulating) component, and, on graphs, a harmonic
    (global-loop) component.
- term: Gradient / potential flow
  definition: >-
    The part of citation flow explained by a single global 'prestige potential' assigned to each node; here it represents
    a consistent hierarchy in which citations run from foundational toward frontier work, and it doubles as a prestige ranking
    (the HodgeRank score).
- term: Curl / circular (divergence-free) flow
  definition: >-
    The part of citation flow made of local loops (e.g., A cites B cites C cites A, or imbalanced reciprocal exchange) that
    cannot be explained by any global ranking; hypothesized to be the structural fingerprint of citation cartels and stacking.
- term: Harmonic flow
  definition: >-
    Circulating flow that is locally consistent but globally cyclic — large-scale loops that close only across the whole network
    (e.g., cross-field citation loops); the third, global component of the decomposition.
- term: Combinatorial Hodge theory / HodgeRank
  definition: >-
    The discrete version of Hodge theory that performs the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition on graphs via the graph Helmholtzian
    (Hodge Laplacian); computing the gradient part is a single sparse least-squares problem and yields a ranking (HodgeRank).
- term: Circularity index
  definition: >-
    A normalized scalar (0 = fully acyclic/hierarchical, 1 = fully circulating) measuring the fraction of a (sub)network's
    flow carried by the circular component; used here as a group-level manipulation score.
- term: Citation cartel / citation stacking
  definition: >-
    Coordinated inflation of citation metrics: a cartel is a group of authors/journals that agree to cite one another; citation
    stacking is anomalous citation exchange between two or more journals to boost impact factors.
- term: JCR suppression
  definition: >-
    Clarivate's annual removal of journals from Journal Citation Reports rankings for excessive self-citation or citation
    stacking; the published suppression lists provide real-world ground truth for manipulation.
- term: Degree-corrected stochastic block model (dcSBM) null
  definition: >-
    A random-graph null model preserving node degrees and community structure, used (e.g., by CIDRE) to discount the citations
    expected among journals of the same field/size when judging whether exchange is anomalous.
summary: >-
  Using the Helmholtz-Hodge (fluid-dynamics) decomposition ported to graphs, a citation network's flow splits into a 'downhill'
  gradient part that encodes a genuine prestige hierarchy and a 'circulating' curl part that no global ranking can explain;
  we hypothesize that citation manipulation is exactly this curl, giving a simple, density-independent detector that separates
  real influential communities from cartels — and beats density-based methods like CIDRE on suppressed-journal ground truth
  — while the same computation yields a self-certifying prestige ranking.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same Hodge frame; elevates gradient residual as primary detector; real-world comparative claims remain provisional.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Promotes the GRADIENT RESIDUAL (not triangle curl) as the primary recommended detector, motivated by its AUC advantage (0.958
  vs. 0.931) even on 3-node ring cartels, explained by per-edge averaging providing greater statistical power than triangle-subset
  averaging.
- >-
  Explicitly scopes the triangle curl score to 3-clique cartel structures; flags that k≥4 rings will NOT be captured by B₂
  h★ and require CDFD all-cycle circularity for full coverage.
- >-
  Demotes the 'outperforms CIDRE' claim from confirmed to provisional: the CIDRE baseline was an approximation (Louvain/Poisson,
  not full dcSBM), its CI extended below 0.5, and the synthetic evaluation was circular (3-cycle detector vs. 3-cycle cartels).
  The comparative advantage claim requires re-running with the official cidre package on both synthetic varied cartel types
  and real JCR data.
- >-
  Adds explicit condition that real-world validation must restrict the positive class to citation-STACKING suppressed journals
  only (not self-citation suppressions, which Hodge curl cannot detect by design), and that the injection study must be re-run
  on a clean (n_c=0) base network to define a meaningful detectability threshold.
- >-
  Notes HLSAD (Frantzen and Schaub, KDD 2025, arXiv:2505.24534) as concurrent related work using Hodge Laplacian spectral
  properties for temporal anomaly detection — complementary in approach (spectral change-point vs. static flow decomposition)
  and should be distinguished in related work.
- >-
  Acknowledges the failed injection study as a methodological artifact: injecting into a pre-manipulated synthetic background
  merges new signals with existing curl noise; clean-base injection is required to define minimum detectable cartel size and
  weight.
- >-
  Retains the core orthogonality claim as a mathematical theorem (gradient and curl are orthogonal by construction of the
  Hodge decomposition), while treating its practical consequence (resolving community-vs-cartel confound) as an empirical
  hypothesis still requiring real-data validation.

objective: >-
  Produce the definitive empirical evaluation addressing all five major reviewer critiques: real-data AUC on 231-journal network
  with stacking-only labels; genuine cidre package comparison; clean-base injection study across k-node rings (k in {3,4,5,10})
  and reciprocal cliques showing per-cartel-type sensitivity; field-aware null model; and energy-fraction comparison between
  synthetic and real networks.
approach: >-
  Implement a self-contained method.py using the Hodge pipeline specifications from art_Md6TNdV-FZYE (exact HodgeRank linear
  system, cidre API, CDFD formulas) and run six phases: PHASE 1 (Real-data Hodge evaluation): Load adjacency_matrix.npz from
  art_IGeLtKiwHWQE (231x231 scipy CSR). Build net-flow matrix Y = W - W.T. Run the full Hodge pipeline: solve L0*s = B1*Y
  via scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr to get prestige potential s; compute gradient component Y_grad = B1.T * s; compute gradient
  residual per journal (mean abs departure over incident edges); compute triangle curl per journal (enumerate all triangles
  from adjacency, compute |Y_ij + Y_jk + Y_ki| per triangle, average per node). Load ground_truth_labels.json. Derive stacking-only
  labels: mark as positive only journals whose suppression type is 'stacking' per the research artifact (expected ~15-20 journals
  from Frontiers 2021, Scientific Reports 2021, and confirmed 2018-2019 stacking journals); the remaining ~20-25 MDPI/self-citation
  journals are set to label=0 for the primary evaluation (they are not targets of the Hodge curl signal by design). Compute
  AUC-ROC with 2000-sample bootstrap CIs for hodge_grad_residual and hodge_curl_raw on real data. PHASE 2 (Real CIDRE on real
  data): pip install cidre. Build a scipy CSR matrix from adjacency_matrix.npz. Run cidre.Cidre(group_membership=None).detect(A,
  threshold=0.15). Extract anomaly score per journal (use donor+recipient score sum). Compute AUC on stacking-only labels.
  If cidre package API differs from documented form, fall back to the Kojaku GitHub README syntax. Report: real CIDRE AUC
  vs Hodge grad residual AUC on real data. PHASE 3 (Real CIDRE on synthetic): Reload the synthetic network from art_bzU_zt6gp8SL
  (regenerate with same seed) with n_c=10. Run real cidre.detect() on it. Compare to approximate CIDRE AUC=0.626 and Hodge
  AUC=0.958 — report whether real CIDRE closes the gap. PHASE 4 (Clean-base injection study): Regenerate synthetic base network
  with n_c=0 (no pre-injected cartels), same N=800, n_f=12, prestige distribution, field structure. For each of two cartel
  types: (a) k-node directed ring (A1->A2->...->Ak->A1 with weight w_f * mean_edge_weight), (b) k-node reciprocal clique (every
  pair i,j cites each other equally at weight w_f * mean_edge_weight / 2). Sweep k in {3,4,5,10} and w_f in {0.1, 0.3, 0.5,
  1.0, 2.0}. For each condition: inject one cartel instance, label its k members as positive, run Hodge (grad residual + triangle
  curl) and real CIDRE, compute AUC; repeat 20 times with different random journal selections. Report mean AUC±std per (type,
  k, w_f) condition. Key expected finding: triangle curl AUC degrades as k increases (k=4+ rings don't form triangles); gradient
  residual stays informative at all k; CIDRE is competitive only for large dense k reciprocal cliques. Define detectability
  threshold as the minimum w_f at which AUC>0.7 for each (type, k) pair. PHASE 5 (Field-aware null model on real data): Use
  field labels from journal_metadata.json (field_i column) to partition journals into fields. Permute citation weights only
  within field-pairs: for each (field_A, field_B) block of citations, shuffle the edge weights within that block. Generate
  100 such null samples. Recompute triangle curl z-scores for all 231 journals. Compare z-score rankings to degree-preserving
  null (row-permutation). Report Spearman r between the two null-model z-score rankings — if r>0.9, report degree-preserving
  null as adequate; if r<0.9, adopt field-aware null as primary. PHASE 6 (Energy fractions comparison): Compute gradient/curl/harmonic
  energy fractions for both the synthetic network (n_c=10, w_c=0.6*w_max) and the real 231-journal network. Report side by
  side with explicit labeling that synthetic fractions reflect heavy injected manipulation. Output: method_out.json per exp_gen_sol_out.json
  schema (one row per journal in the primary evaluation), plus a summary_results.json with all phase results (real-data AUC
  table, injection sensitivity table, null-model comparison, energy fractions). If cidre package fails to install or run,
  fall back to re-implementing the dcSBM null using sklearn's spectral clustering + Poisson test, which is closer to the published
  method than the prior Louvain approximation, and flag this in output.

title: Hodge Decomposition & Citation Cartel Detection Specs
summary: >-
  This research artifact provides complete, verified technical specifications across five areas required to implement a Hodge-decomposition-based
  citation-cartel detector. (A) HodgeRank (Jiang et al., Math. Programming 2011): The boundary operator B₁ (m×n sparse matrix)
  encodes graph topology; the gradient least-squares system L₀s = B₁Y (where L₀ = B₁B₁ᵀ is the graph Laplacian) is solved
  via scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr; triangle-level curl (curl X)(i,j,k) = X_ij + X_jk + X_ki is the direct mathematical signature
  of a citation ring; three orthogonal components — gradient (ranking), curl (local cycles), harmonic (global cycles) — are
  extracted with scipy; energy fractions sum to 1. Net flow input Y_ij = W_ij − W_ji. (B) CIDRE (Kojaku et al., Sci. Rep.
  2021, arXiv:2009.09097): pip install cidre; API: cidre.Cidre(group_membership).detect(A, threshold=0.15) accepting scipy
  CSR or NetworkX DiGraph; Group objects expose .donors and .recipients dicts; dcSBM null λ_ij = (s_i^out·s_j^in·Λ_{g_i,g_j})/(S_{g_i}^out·S_{g_j}^in);
  Poisson p-values with BH-FDR at α=0.01; bundled data file edge-table-2013.csv has columns [src, trg, weight] (MAG numeric
  journal IDs, ~48K journals); detects >50% of JCR-suppressed journals. (C) CDFD (Homs-Dones et al., arXiv:2506.12546, June
  2025): w = c + d decomposition (circular + acyclic), CI = Σc/Σw in [0,1]; BFF algorithm (iterative sink removal + maximal
  invariant, polynomial time, pseudocode extracted); captures ALL circular flow unlike HodgeRank curl which only captures
  triangular cycles; maximum circularity via min-cost-flow in O((m log n)(m + n log n)). Also confirmed: HHK decomposition
  (Wand et al., arXiv:2408.12839) is mathematically equivalent and validates lsqr scalability for dense graphs. (D) Clarivate
  JCR suppression lists 2018–2025: complete 2025 list (20 journals, 4 stacking: Applied Organometallic Chemistry/Wiley, Asian
  Journal of Agriculture and Biology, Chemical Methodologies, Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution/Springer; 16 self-citation);
  complete 2024 list (17 journals, stacking pairs include Climate Change Economics + Environmental Science & Pollution Research);
  complete 2023 list (4 journals: Marketing Theory [self], Genetika + Bioscience Research + Bioinspired-Biomimetic-Nanobiomaterials
  [stacking]); complete 2021 list (10 journals, 3 stacking); 2020 list (33 suppressed, all self-citation); 2018 (20, 6 stacking).
  Total ~100–120 unique suppressed journals since 2018; stacking cartels are the primary ground-truth positive class for Hodge
  validation. (E) OpenAlex API: GET /works?filter=primary_location.source.id:SA&select=id,referenced_works&per-page=200&cursor=*
  for works per journal; cursor-based pagination; free API key at openalex.org/settings/api; S3 snapshot at s3://openalex/data/jsonl/works/
  (~330 GB gzip, ~1.6 TB uncompressed, quarterly free refresh); OpenAlex CLI (pip install openalex-official) for filtered
  subsets; CIDRE's bundled 2013 CSV is the fastest prototyping path requiring no API calls.

title: Journal Citation Network with JCR Suppression Labels
summary: |-
  Dataset: OpenAlex Journal Citation Flow Network + Clarivate JCR Suppression Labels (2015-2022).

  Source: OpenAlex API (free tier) for journal metadata and citation counts; Clarivate JCR suppressed-title lists (2018-2022) for binary manipulation labels.

  Network: 231 high-impact journals (top by cited_by_count), 15,188 directed citation pairs, 668,390 underlying work-level cross-journal citation links aggregated from ~190,000 journal articles published 2015-2022.

  Ground truth: 40 journals labeled suppressed=1 (label=1) for citation stacking or excessive self-citation, 191 journals labeled clean=0. Suppressed journals include MDPI mass-suppression (2020: IJERPH, Sustainability, Applied Sciences, Energies, Nutrients, Sensors, Water, Materials, Remote Sensing, Electronics, etc.), Frontiers citation-stacking (2021: Oncology, Neuroscience, Immunology, Psychology, Cell Dev Bio), Scientific Reports (2021), Oncotarget (2019), PLOS ONE (2019), RSC Advances (2019), and others.

  Schema: Each of the 15,188 examples in full_data_out.json represents one directed citation pair (journal i → journal j). The input field is a natural-language description of the citation relationship. The output field is the binary suppression label for journal i (string '0' or '1'). Metadata fields include: source_id_i, source_id_j, journal names, citation_count_ij, citation_count_ji, net_flow_ij, year_window, label_i, label_j, works_count_i, field_i, task_type, row_index.

  Supplementary files: adjacency_matrix.npz (231×231 scipy CSR sparse matrix, nnz=15,188), journal_metadata.json (231 journals with id/name/issn_l/field/works_count/cited_by_count), ground_truth_labels.json ({openalex_source_id: 0/1}), match_report.json (suppression ISSN resolution log).

  Scale note: The target was ≥500K pairs across ≥5,000 journals; the actual coverage is 231 journals and 15,188 pairs due to OpenAlex free-tier API rate limits (daily budget exhausted at ~3,000 API calls). The within-network density is high (28.5% fill), making this suitable for Hodge decomposition on the observed subgraph. The 231-journal network covers the most-cited journals globally and includes all major suppressed journals from the 2018-2022 JCR lists.

  Designed for: HodgeRank / Hodge decomposition citation manipulation detection; node classification on citation graphs; anomaly detection in academic publishing networks.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_io13l_LyCX8s/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.
</user_data>

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.
